# Project 2 : Templated Stack
### Made for data structures course fall 2019

### Instructions I was given for this homework project (full PDF in files)
For this assignment you must write the template for a generalized stack class. This template should be
based on the stack you implemented in Part 1; this means your stack class should be able to handle any
type of data.

You should then write a program that tests your template. You create an instance of your template for
the following data types: int, double, string and at least two classes of your own design and
implementation. You should perform the following for each instance of the stack:

1. Push at least 3 elements of data onto the stack
2. Output the contents of the stack
3. Peek at the top of the stack
4. Output the results of the peek
5. Pop all but one element from the stack
6. Output the contents of the stack
7. Pop the last element from the stack
8. Output the results of the pop
9. Peek at the top of the stack

The custom classes you design and implement should contain at least two elements of member data
and support the clerical methods necessary to set and get those values. Each class must also overload
the << operator.
